2. Select **Backend pools** from the left menu.

3. Select **BP-WEB**.

4. Under **Backend targets**, **Target type**, select **Virtual machine** from the drop-down list.

5. Under **Target**, select the **VMWEB01** and **VMWEB02** virtual machines and their associated network interfaces from the drop-down lists.
